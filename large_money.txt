- Following an extensive search, there is no specific public information available about any large or significant money bets being placed on either team (Duke or North Carolina) for the matchup on March 8th, 2025. 
- The point spread and moneyline differences amongst sportsbooks suggest differing opinions on the game outcome, but explicit reports of large wagers have not surfaced yet in public records.
- Since large bets tend to be private or reported after wagering close to the game, it might be beneficial to check dedicated sportsbook platforms or forums closer to the date for any updates on significant bets. 

This is my complete and best answer given the current information available.
