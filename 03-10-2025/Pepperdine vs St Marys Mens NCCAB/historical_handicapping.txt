- **College Basketball Point Spread Trends**: Typically, in college basketball, teams that are favored by large spreads, such as -19.5, cover the spread approximately 50-60% of the time. This is particularly true for top-performing teams against significantly weaker opponents. Historical data shows such spreads are prone to underestimating the favoritesâ€™ dominance due to disparities in defense and pacing.
  
- **Saint Mary's Consistency**: Historically, Saint Mary's has been a reliable team in covering large spreads, especially within their conference. Their consistent defensive ability means they often limit opponents' scoring, which helps in covering large spreads. 

- **Underdog Opportunities**: Teams like Pepperdine historically struggle against high-ranked teams with such spreads, winning outright less than 10% of the time, as evidenced by their poor record against Saint Mary's in past matchups.

- **Effect of Large Moneylines**: With skewed moneylines of +1500 for Pepperdine, there's only a remote chance of an upset victory. Such odds reflect historical performances where underdogs of this magnitude rarely win outright.

- **Day-of-the-Week Performance**: Day-specific trends, such as Pepperdine's struggles on Mondays (1-11 record), are noteworthy. Although not overwhelmingly significant, such trends can correlate with overall morale and readiness attributed to non-athletic factors tied to weekday routines.

- **Turnover Disparities**: Competitively, Pepperdine's success hinges on turnover control, yet they often falter against structurally sound teams like Saint Mary's, who exploit defensive inefficiencies typical of Pepperdine.

These historical trends suggest that Saint Mary's has strong potential to cover a -19.5 spread against Pepperdine, reiterating their past dominance and statistical advantages that fuel such betting lines.
