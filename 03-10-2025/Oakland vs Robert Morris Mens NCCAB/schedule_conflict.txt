- **Scheduling Gap for Oakland:**
  - Oakland played their previous game on March 6, 2025, against Milwaukee and will face Robert Morris on March 10, 2025. There are no back-to-back games, and the gap should allow for adequate rest.

- **Scheduling Gap for Robert Morris:**
  - Robert Morris also played on March 6, 2025, against Wright State, facing Oakland on March 10, 2025. Similar to Oakland, they have a four-day gap between games, providing enough rest and preparation time.

- **Travel Considerations:**
  - The game against Robert Morris is scheduled in Indianapolis, a central location, which minimizes extensive travel impact for either team, especially considering the previous matches were also within the Horizon League's regional footprint.

Overall, there are no immediate scheduling conflicts or excessive travel burdens for either team leading up to their game on March 10, 2025.
