Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve specific information about the referees officiating the game between Troy and James Madison on March 9, 2025, or detailed statistics about their officiating tendencies such as fouls called per game or points scored in their games. Generally, for NCAA games, official assignments tend to be released closer to the game date or are sometimes shared during the game broadcast itself. To get the desired information, keeping an eye on the official game program or broadcast updates would be the most reliable approach.
